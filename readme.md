# WGUPS Delivery System

## Introduction

This project is a simulation of a package delivery system for the Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS). The system is designed to deliver packages to various locations in Salt Lake City, Utah. The system uses a custom built hash table to store package information, using a `k-Nearest Neighbors` algorithm to derive the most efficient route to use.
